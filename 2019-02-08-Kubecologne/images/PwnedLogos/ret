On further investigation, the file was also found to contain data indicating it had been sourced from <a href="https://armorgames.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Armor Games</a>. Subsequent verification with HIBP subscribers confirmed the passwords had previously been used and many subscribers had used either Coupon Mom or Armor Games in the past.
